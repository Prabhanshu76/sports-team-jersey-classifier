# sports-team-jersey-classifier

This repository contains code for classifying player jerseys into two teams based on their color. The classification is achieved using unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering. The code processes images, extracts color features, applies K-Means clustering, and displays the results along with the predicted team labels.
